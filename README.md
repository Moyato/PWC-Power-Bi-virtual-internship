## Introduction
I came across this dataset on the forage website provided by PWC Switzerland. It contains Three datasets looking at key performance metrics for the Telcom PhoneNow. 
The dataset contains 3 sheets;
-	Call center dataset 
-	Diversity inclusion dataset
-	Churn dataset

### Problem statement
How best to create a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.

### Skills demonstrated
---
-	Use of DAX functions
-	Use of colors and segmenting data


### Analysis and visualizations
Looking at the call center dataset, we can see that the average customer satisfaction rate does not meet the target value. Also, we can see that the average satisfaction rating for each agent does not go past 3.5 and no one meet the target of 4.5.

In the churn dataset, the dataset was segmented into two groups churn analysis and customer analysis.  In the churn analysis we can see that in contract type most people use a month to month contract but it has the highest churn rate. We can also see that electronic cheques bring in the most total or yearly charges but has the highest churn rate.

In diversity inclusion dataset, for hiring we can see that past senior officers the hiring rate between men and women becomes increasingly disproportionate were men are hired more. In promotions we can see that women have to spend more time at the job compared to men to be promoted.  

### Conclusion and recommendation 
PhoneNow can retrain their agents in order to increase customer satisfaction. They can also make it easer to make payments through electronic cheques so as not to lose customers and also make the prices offering of month to month contracts more enticing so as not to lose customers. 
They can also hire more women in higher positions to aid diversity and inclusion in the workforce. Also promote capable women earlier in their careers to promote diversity and inclusion.
